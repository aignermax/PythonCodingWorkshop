# Python Coding Workshop

A comprehensive workshop demonstrating Python programming concepts with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles.


## Project Structure
## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming
- Class creation and instantiation
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Static methods and class methods
- Property decorators
- Helper classes and utility functions

### 2. SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
  - Each class should have only one reason to change
  
- **O**pen-Closed Principle
  - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
  - Example: Discount calculation using strategy pattern
  
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
  - Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
  
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
  - Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use
  
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle
  - Depend upon abstractions, not concretions

## Code Examples

### Open-Closed Principle Example

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
